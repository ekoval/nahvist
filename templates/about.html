<h2>On Tail</h2>

<p>
I don't have a car, and I often need to go somewhere, where it's hard to get
without car. One of the recent examples is a Tustan festival.
From the other side, many people go there by car, and they would like to find
a companion, which will reduce their expenses, and make journey funnier.

This project is intended to help these people to find each other.
